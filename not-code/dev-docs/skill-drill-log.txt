-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        o  Timeout - refactor to make main model yaml compatible
            o  Remove pointer based relationships and use uids instead for
               data-owning fields. (Retain ptrs non serialized objects) 
                *  preview mentally
                *  just hack the internal classes into expected shape
                    *  implementation modules
                    *  test module
                *  resurrect buildable
                *  resurrect test passes
            o  Change primary storage of skills and people to being lists,
               and then dont need serialise class
               o  Give api these lists as public attr
               o  Change api actions to insert new items into list, but also
                  create lookups - from skill uid and email
               o  Serialise might now just work if call yaml.marshal on it,
               o  If so ditch separate conversion
               o  Make sure api comment explains serialisable form





            o  Refactor serialization to avoid separate data structures
        o  Serialise
            *  Ditch and start again
            *  Design file format = yaml
            o  Design top down arch
                *  Try MarshalYAML native
                    *  Get package
                o  Bugs so far
                    o  Only two skills coming out
                    o  ids are garbage
            o  Deserialise
        o  Set classes using ptrs as keys? - maybe set of uid?
        o  unit test for tests
        o  Add in app state and user states

Model use cases
    o  From user actions
        o  Register user with skill / deregister
        o  Edit skill title or desc
        o  Fmt desc with / without context of hierachy
        o  Fmt root of desc to aide editing
        o  List emails of people with skill
        o  Has this user, this skill
        o  Enumerate display model Collapse / expand behaviour
    o  From lifecycle
        o  Level of node
        o  Serialise whole model
        o  Build model from serialised
    o  From admin
