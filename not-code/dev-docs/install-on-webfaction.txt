                        Installation on Webfaction

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ESSENCE
        o  In essence...
        o  Install Mercurial and modify our .bash_profile
        o  Use Mercurial to pull the latest Go source
        o  Compile the source with passing unit tests!
        o  Setup your initial GOPATH workspace
        o  Add a custom Webfaction application to secure an available port
        o  Add a super simple helloworld.go web application and run it!
        o  Finally, point a Webfaction website to your new Go web application!

INSTALLING GO LANGUAGE

    o  At time of writing (Dec 2014), you need to install from source...
    o  Follow: https://golang.org/doc/install/source
    o  And:

    Build test problems encountered:

        o  2 (fixable) Test failures...
        o  See my contribution to webfaction community here:
            https://community.webfaction.com/questions/...
            ... 16937/cannot-build-golang-from-source

CUSTOM APP

    o  Set up custom app listening on port in control panel.
    o  Note assigned port number.
    o  In my example case it is: 12571
    o  Bind to website and domain
    o  In my case skilldrill.wim42.webfactional.com


TEST BUILD / RUN SERVER

    o  Clone the skilldrill github repo on server.
    o  Build it with Go
    o  Run the exe created manually
    o  Point browser to 
    o  ... skilldrill.wim42.webfactional.com
    o  Just works !

ALTERNATIVE

    o  Try cross compile on Windows to run on Webfaction server

    o  Environment variable requirements
        o  Values are taken from attempt to build from source on real
           Webfaction machine

        o  GOOS = linux
        o  GOARCH = 386
        o  CGO_ENABLED = 1 // won't compile so changed to 0
        o  GOARM (not set)

    o  Set these in a dos shell, then run all.bat in same shell.
    o  Just works!
    o  Do go install to get progs in sensible places
    o  ftp file to webfaction
    o  chmod it 777
    o  it just works
