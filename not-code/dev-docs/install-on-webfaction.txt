        o  Install Mercurial and modify our .bash_profile
        o  Use Mercurial to pull the latest Go source
        o  Compile the source with passing unit tests!
        o  Setup your initial GOPATH workspace
        o  Add a custom Webfaction application to secure an available port
        o  Add a super simple helloworld.go web application and run it!
        o  Finally, point a Webfaction website to your new Go web application!
