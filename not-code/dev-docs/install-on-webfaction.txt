                        Installation on Webfaction

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHOICES
        o  Could install go on Webfaction and build executables from
           cloned source repo in situ.
        o  Or could cross compile for linux/386 from local Windows dev env.
        o  Tried former - and worked after false start with wrong MingGW.
        o  See golang-nuts post 16937
        o  Also tried cross compile and will favour this to anticipate providing
           viable binaries for multiple platforms once app is mature.

ESSENCE
        o  In essence... (assuming cross compilation)
        o  Add a custom Webfaction application to secure an available port
        o  Add a super simple helloworld.go web application and run it!
        o  Finally, point a Webfaction website to your new Go web application!

CUSTOM APP

    o  Set up custom app listening on port in control panel.
    o  Note assigned port number.
    o  In my example case it is: 12571
    o  Bind to website and domain
    o  In my case skilldrill.wim42.webfactional.com


TEST BUILD / RUN SERVER

    o  X compile from Windows dev box - see below
    o  Point browser to 
    o  ... skilldrill.wim42.webfactional.com
    o  Just works !

    o  Environment variable requirements
        o  Values are taken from attempt to build from source on real
           Webfaction machine

        o  GOOS = linux
        o  GOARCH = 386
        o  CGO_ENABLED = 1 // won't compile so changed to 0
        o  GOARM (not set)

    o  Set these in a dos shell, then run all.bat in same shell.
    o  Just works!
    o  Do go install to get progs in sensible places
    o  ftp file to webfaction
    o  chmod it 777
    o  it just works
